# Overview

This is a Brazilian Import Tax Calculator web application built with Flask. It helps importers calculate all taxes, costs, and project profit margins when reselling imported products in Brazil. The application integrates with government APIs and currency conversion services to provide accurate, real-time calculations for import duties, taxes (II, IPI, PIS, COFINS, ICMS), and total landed costs.

The system supports user authentication, calculation history, saved scenarios, and provides a comprehensive dashboard for managing import analyses. It's designed for importers, tax consultants, and purchasing analysts who need to evaluate the economic viability of importing products to Brazil.
